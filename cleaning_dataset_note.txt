title basics:
    - titleType: 
        * remove this row.
        * there are a a lot of tvEpisodesm which could skew the results.
    - endyear: remove this column
    - runtimeMinutes:
        * replace missing values with ...
        * there are two clusters of runtime minutes. What to do?
        * remove outliers
    - primaryTitle: drop
    - originalTitle: drop
    - isAsult: remove records that are adult.
    - startYear:
        * I have a bias for movies released in the last 10 years, i need to remove that bias to find interesting results.
        * remove outliers.
    - endYear: Drop. There is not enough data for it to be meaningful.

genres:
    * maybe remove all genres with less counts than animation?

title_rate:
    - averageRating: replace two lowest values (outliers) with the median.
    - numVotes: replace the higher outliers with the median.

writers & directors:
    We take everything

ordering:
    - category:
        * Keep: actor, producer, writer, actress, director
    - nconst: keep the nconst's that occur 2 times or more
    - ordering: probably better to remove this one.

name_basics:
    - primaryName: remove
    - remove values that don't have a birthyear or deathyear (568)
    - remove the values that have no birthyear but have a deathyear, because there are only 2.
    - There are a lot of values that don't have a deathyear.
        We can replace deathyear with an 'is alive column' and an age at filming column.


primary_profession:
    - keep:  producer, writer, actor, soundtrack, director, miscellaneous, actress, music_department, composer

known_for:
    - use this to figure out all the personell per movie !!!
    - we can also use this to give actors an relative equal score, based on the movie score.

directors:
    Clean. Probably best to not use the directors information from the ordering file or the job file.

writers:
    clean. Use this instead of ordering and job file.

job:
    - needs to be cleaned, a lot.
    - maybe better to not use it.

character:
    

figuring out:
    * Is it useful to give actors a score on basis of their ordering?
    * can we give the actors a general score on their knownForTitles movies?
